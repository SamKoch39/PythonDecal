print((69851773671620)/(4298632219792)) #I chose these numbers because they simplify to an evil fraction, 130/8. I joined Math 53 late, and this past Monday I was informed of homework due at 11:59 pm that night. This fraction is evil because it represents the number of problems I was assigned divided by the number of hours I had to do them.This also explains the evil numbers title of the file#python evilnumbers.py
