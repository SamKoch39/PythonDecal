3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?
My first course of action would be to read the error and determine whether I understand why it occurred. Regardless, I would reread my code to see whether I can identify anything wrong. If I can't and I didn't understand the error, I would look up the meaning and how to fix it. If I still couldn't figure it out at that point, I would ask a friend and lastly an Instructor.
 
4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
The funniest thing that happened to me in high school was my ridiculous math teacher. She would spend classes talking about how aliens are the cause of a huge boulder getting put into place or how her daughter was a miracle baby. She would say the wildest things and my classmates and eye would just look at each other like ._.

5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
A python script is a file containing code that is meant to be run in order to accomplish something. It contains what is essentially a set of directions telling your computer to perform a task.
